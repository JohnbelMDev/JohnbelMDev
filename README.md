## Hi There!
<p>As a son of a Haitian immigrant mother. I was taught that education would be the key to success, not just for me, but for many generations to come. As a software developer I’m looking to break barriers and expose more people to the possibilities of emerging technologies. I wouldn’t be where I am today if it wouldn’t be for the guidance of my mentors in higher education. In college, I used my experience as a photographer to become a founder for the photography club, while also gaining my cybersecurity certificates as I worked in I.T support on campus. I’m looking forward to joining your company and continuing my skills to analyze, create and solve. </p>
